## DEVELOPMENT TOOLING SETUP

- [ ] install xcode and the developer tools
- [ ] install homebrew
- [ ] install and verify a modern version of git
- [ ] install and run code a code editor, atom or sublime text 
- [ ] install and configure rbenv and ruby version 2.2 or higher 

## GENERAL RUBY PROGRAMMING

- [ ] Recognize and verify basic data types `String` `Hash` `Array` `Boolean` `Fixnum` `Float` and `nil`
- [ ] Create and use a variable
- [ ] Define a method
- [ ] Define input parameters to a method
- [ ] Use input parameters inside a method
- [ ] Create both explicit and implicit return values
- [ ] Run a ruby script
- [ ] Differentiate between return value and print statements
- [ ] Create a class definition with both instance and class methods
- [ ] Use local and instance variables inside a class definition
- [ ] Instantiate a defined class
- [ ] Write a program that uses both `if else end` and `unless end` conditional logic

## RUBY STRING

- [ ] Create and differentiate `''` from `""` based Strings
- [ ] Demonstrate `String` concatenation
- [ ] Demonstrate `String` interpolation
- [ ] Substitute the contents of a string using `.sub` and `.gsub`
- [ ] Write a method that uses an equality check `==` to return different strings
- [ ] Demonstate awareness of the index positions inside a `String`
- [ ] Manually iterate from left to right, right to left of a `String`

## RUBY ARRAY

- [ ] Create an `Array`
- [ ] Populate an `Array` with a `String`, `Hash`, `Boolean`, `nil`, `Fixnum`, `Float` even another `Array`
- [ ] Access an `Array` with at least 5 things using an index based lookup
- [ ] Access the first and the last element of an `Array` without knowing the length of the `Array`
- [ ] Manually iterate from left to right, right to left of an `Array`
- [ ] Demonstrate the use of `.each` and an the associated block `do |thing| ; end`
- [ ] Demonstrate awareness of how `.map()` and `.each()` are different
- [ ] Write a reasonably complex method that uses `.inject(Thing)`
- [ ] Demonstrate how to return and remove the first or last thing from an `Array`

## RUBY HASH

- [ ] Create a `Hash`
- [ ] Demonstrate awarenes of a key value pair
- [ ] Populate a `Hash` with at least 3 key value pairs
- [ ] Create a `Hash` that uses `Symbol` as keys
- [ ] Create a `Hash` that uses `String` as keys
- [ ] Create a `Hash` that uses `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, `Fixnum`, `Float` as values
- [ ] Demonstrate how to access a value in a `Hash` by executing a key lookup
- [ ] Iterate over all key value pairs in a `Hash`
- [ ] Demonstrate awareness of how an `Array` uses index and a `Hash` uses a key

## APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT - THE REQUEST (ie, the client)

- [ ] Build an html page with `<head></head><body></body>` and `<form></form>` elements
- [ ] Build a resonably complex html layout using as many html elements and css attributes as possible
- [ ] Manually write a hyper link that has at least 2 query parameters
- [ ] Demonstrate three different ways to create a `GET` request to a local server
- [ ] Manually write a `<Form>` that that can create a `POST` request to a local server
- [ ] Manually write a `<Form>` that that can create a `PUT` request to a local server
- [ ] Manually write a `<Form>` that that can create a `DELETE` request to a local server
- [ ] Demonstrate awareness of the different between the browser process (the requestor) and the server process (the responder)
- [ ] Demonstrate awareness of the difference between a request made to a local server and a server located on the internet
- [ ] Dissect  `http://waffles.io:9999/pancakes/1278Ikllkj` url into protocol, server, port and uri components.
- [ ] Use jquery to dynamically change the DOM
- [ ] User jquery to create asyncronous `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` actions to a remote server
- [ ] Demonstrate awareness of the differenece between syncronous and asyncronous client/server interactions


## APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT - THE RESPONSE (ie, the server)

- [ ] Create a server with two different endpoints that run the same program with identical return values
- [ ] Create a server with two different endpoints that run the same program with identical return values but returned in different data formats, (json, html and text blob)
- [ ] Create a server that accepts a `GET` request and returns relevant feedback to the requestor (client)
- [ ] Create a server that accepts a `POST` request and uses the body of the request to write data into a database, return relevant feedback to the requestor (client)
- [ ] Create a server that accepts a `PUT` request and uses the body of the request  update data into a database, return relevant feedback to the requestor (client)
- [ ] Create a server endpoint that accepts a `DELETE` request and uses the body of the request  destroy data from a database, return relevant feedback to the requestor (client)
- [ ] Create a server endpoint that allows for the creation of a many to many database record
- [ ]
